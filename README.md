Spiral PHP Framework
=======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spiral/spiral.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spiral/spiral)

The Spiral framework provides a Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform to develop software applications 
using an MVC architecture, using a simple but strong syntax similar to other popular frameworks.

Spiral was originally built in 2009 for internal projects and has been continuously updated over the last
few years. In 2015, I decided to open source the framework so that developers had a better way to build
custom applications quickly.

Framework and toolkit roadmap
-----------------------------
* Documentation in a process
* Few tutorials and quick start videos
* Authorization module with integration with ORM (and maybe ODM), i'm still thinking about the most optimal
  implementation (heading to RBAC with NIST model level 2b)
* Universal administration panel with flexible design, RBAC (NIST) and set of generators - http://prntscr.com/8cwddl
* Tests coverage
