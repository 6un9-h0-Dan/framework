Spiral PHP Framework
=======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spiral/spiral.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spiral/spiral)

The Spiral framework provides a Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform to develop software applications 
using an MVC architecture, using a simple but strong syntax similar to other popular frameworks.

Spiral was originally built in 2009 for internal projects and has been continuous updated over the last
 few years. In 2015, I decided to open source the framework so that developers had a better way to build
  custom applications quickly.  

Base application with modules, views and routing: https://github.com/spiral-php/application

Guide: https://github.com/spiral-php/guide

Currently in development:
- ORM Eager Loading Refactoring
- ORM Relations Mapping
- ORM Abstract and Parent classes handling
- ORM Virtual Documentation generation
- ORM UML export (only classes export done at the moment)
- HTTP PSR7 update to match the latest specs
