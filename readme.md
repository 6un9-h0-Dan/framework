The Spiral framework provides a Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform to develop software applications 
using an HMVC architecture, using a simple but strong syntax similar to other popular frameworks.

Spiral was originally built in 2009 for internal projects and has been continuously updated over the last
few years. In 2015, I decided to open source the framework so that developers had a better way to build
custom applications quickly.
