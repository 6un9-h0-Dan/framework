/**
 * Representation of an incoming, server-side HTTP request.
 *
 * Per the HTTP specification, this interface includes properties for
 * each of the following:
 *
 * - Protocol version
 * - HTTP method
 * - URI
 * - Headers
 * - Message body
 *
 * Additionally, it encapsulates all data as it has arrived to the
 * application from the CGI and/or PHP environment, including:
 *
 * - The values represented in $_SERVER.
 * - Any cookies provided (generally via $_COOKIE)
 * - Query string arguments (generally via $_GET, or as parsed via parse_str())
 * - Upload files, if any (as represented by $_FILES)
 * - Deserialized body parameters (generally from $_POST)
 *
 * $_SERVER values MUST be treated as immutable, as they represent application
 * state at the time of request; as such, no methods are provided to allow
 * modification of those values. The other values provide such methods, as they
 * can be restored from $_SERVER or the request body, and may need treatment
 * during the application (e.g., body parameters may be deserialized based on
 * content type).
 *
 * Additionally, this interface recognizes the utility of introspecting a
 * request to derive and match additional parameters (e.g., via URI path
 * matching, decrypting cookie values, deserializing non-form-encoded body
 * content, matching authorization headers to users, etc). These parameters
 * are stored in an "attributes" property.
 *
 * Requests are considered immutable; all methods that might change state MUST
 * be implemented such that they retain the internal state of the current
 * message and return an instance that contains the changed state.
